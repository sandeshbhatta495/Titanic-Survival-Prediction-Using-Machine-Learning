# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

A classic Machine Learning mini-project where I explore, clean, and model the Titanic dataset to predict which passengers survived the infamous shipwreck. This project is part of my AI/ML learning journey, and it marks my first complete end-to-end ML workflow — from raw data to Kaggle submission.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict survival on the Titanic using passenger data (classification problem).
- **Dataset:** [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- **Model Used:** Logistic Regression
- **Accuracy Achieved:** ~73.67% (Training)

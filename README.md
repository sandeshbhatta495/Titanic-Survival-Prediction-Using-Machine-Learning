# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

A classic Machine Learning mini-project where I explore, clean, and model the Titanic dataset to predict which passengers survived the infamous shipwreck. This project is part of my AI/ML learning journey, and it marks my first complete end-to-end ML workflow — from raw data to Kaggle submission.

# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Overview

This project is part of my AI/ML learning journey (Day 1–8), where I built a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using supervised learning techniques. It’s an end-to-end implementation starting from raw data to a complete prediction pipeline.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal is to predict whether a given passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, sex, class, fare, and more.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 🐍
* Pandas 📊
* NumPy 🔢
* Scikit-learn 🤖
* Matplotlib & Seaborn 📈
* Jupyter Notebook 📓

## 📂 Dataset

Kaggle's Titanic Dataset:

* `train.csv` - training data
* `test.csv` - test data
* `gender_submission.csv` - sample submission

## 🔍 Workflow

### 1. Data Loading & Exploration

* Loaded CSV files into DataFrames
* Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Visualized feature distributions

### 2. Data Preprocessing

* Handled missing values (`fillna`, `dropna`)
* Dropped irrelevant columns (Ticket, Cabin, Name)
* Feature Engineering (e.g., created new features)
* Label Encoding for categorical variables
* Exported cleaned dataset

### 3. Model Training

* Used Logistic Regression for binary classification
* Split training data using `train_test_split`
* Evaluated using accuracy (Train Accuracy: 70.2%)
* Final Kaggle Score: **73.67%**

### 4. Submission

* Made predictions on test set
* Exported results as `submission.csv`
* Submitted to Kaggle Titanic competition

## 📈 Output

* Final model: Logistic Regression
* Accuracy: \~73.67% (Kaggle LB Score)
* Submission file created successfully

## 🧠 What I Learned

* How to clean and preprocess data
* Importance of EDA and feature selection
* Model building and validation
* How to submit results on Kaggle
* Fundamentals of real-world ML pipelines

## 🔮 What’s Next?

* Model evaluation with precision, recall, F1-score
* Cross-validation & hyperparameter tuning
* Explore Decision Trees & Random Forests
* Dive into ensemble learning techniques
